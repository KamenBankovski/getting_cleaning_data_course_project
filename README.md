# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

Author - **Kamen Bankovski**

## Overview

The presented dataset is a submission for the final assignment of the 
Getting and Cleaning Data course as part of the Data Science specialization
by John Hopkins University offered through Coursera.

The aim of the assignment has been to collect and clean the data from the Human Activitiy Recognition Using Smartphones Study[1] and prepare the data for future analysis.

The source data for the presented dataset is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set[1], built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

## The dataset

The dataset includes the following files: 
1. `summ_data.csv` - the clean and tidy dataset
2. `CodeBook.md` - Describing the study design and the variables used
3. `run_analysis.R` - an R script that takes the UCI HAR dataset as an input,              performs an analysis and outputs a tidy, clean dataset of the mean measures of          the mean and standard deviation of the measures of the UCI HAR dataset on a by          subject by activity basis. 
4. `README.md` - explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Additional Information

For further information regarding the activities performed by the `run_analysis.R` script please review the `CodeBook.md` file present in the dataset.
